# GithubCommitsViewer
## Simple CLI project for interview
Simple CLI project for saving commits basic information into db storage

## How to configure
There is no configuration file, as this is so much redundant, that i didnt want to waste time on it, just open GithubCommitsViewer.Application.Extension and replace *CONNECTION-STRING-PLACEHOLDER*
